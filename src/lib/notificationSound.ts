// Custom notification sound.
//
// The Web Notifications API has no "custom sound file" option — it was in
// early spec drafts but no browser ever implemented it, and `showNotification()`
// only ever plays the OS/browser's own default alert sound (unless `silent`
// is set). So a website has exactly one way to play a *real* custom sound
// file for a notification: from live JS, while a tab or window for the app
// is open (foreground or backgrounded — this does NOT run if the app is
// fully closed/swiped away, since there's no JS execution context left to
// play audio from).
//
// public/sw.js posts a PLAY_NOTIFICATION_SOUND message to every open
// client whenever it shows a push notification or the Pomodoro-complete
// notification; this file just listens for that and plays the clip.
