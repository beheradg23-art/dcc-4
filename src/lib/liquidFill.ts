// --- one-shot "swipe reveal" played the instant a hover starts -----------
//
// Previously every hover-triggered gradient (icon badge fill, heading text
// fill, the card's animated ring) just snapped in at full opacity the
// moment `hovering` became true. This adds a single-play sweep that masks
// each of those in behind a soft, feathered edge that travels from the
// bottom-left corner to the top-right corner once, so the gradient reveals
// itself rather than appearing instantly — the "fade in swipe" effect
// layers on top of (not instead of) the existing infinite liquid drift,
// the same way a one-off entrance animation is combined with a looping one
// elsewhere in this file.
//
// Two earlier attempts at this didn't pan out, worth noting so they don't
// get re-tried: (1) animating the mask gradient's *stop offsets* directly
// across keyframes isn't reliably interpolated cross-browser — several
// engines just snap straight to the end frame instead of sweeping through
// it; (2) a `clip-path: polygon(...)` sweep interpolates fine and *did*
// visibly sweep, but a polygon clip is a hard geometric cut with no way to
// soften its edge — there's no such thing as a "feathered polygon".
//
// This version instead registers `--akyos-sweep` as a real animatable
// percentage via `@property` (supported in current Chrome/Edge/Safari;
// degrades to a single non-smooth jump on the rare browser without it,
// same as any progressive-enhancement custom-property animation) and
// keeps the gradient's own text completely static — only that one custom
// property changes across the keyframes, referenced through `calc()`. That
// sidesteps both earlier problems: a genuinely numeric value is what's
// being interpolated (not gradient syntax), and the gradient's transparent
// -> white transition zone (width set by SWEEP_FEATHER_PCT below) gives an
// actual soft edge rather than a hard line. White, not black, for the
// opaque stop — this file's other mask (the ring cutout, a few lines
// down) already uses `#fff` for the same reason: masking defaults to
// luminance mode in some engines, where transparent-to-*black* reads as
// "zero luminance either way" and never reveals anything.
//
// `to bottom left` is a real CSS gradient keyword, not an approximated
// angle — it points exactly from the top-right corner to the opposite
// corner regardless of the element's own aspect ratio, which is what was
// asked for (a 36px square icon badge and a wide card both get a true
// corner-to-corner sweep, not just a similar-looking one).

// The exact photographic-negative of SWEEP_REVEAL_STYLE above — same
// `--akyos-sweep` variable, same feather width, same direction, just with
// the transparent/white stops swapped. Used to hide the plain white base
// heading text in lockstep with the gradient copy revealing on top of it.
//
// Why this exists: the gradient copy's mask has a soft (feathered) edge,
// which is required so the sweep doesn't look like a hard clip. But a soft
// mask means there's a band, `SWEEP_FEATHER_PCT` wide, where the gradient
// copy sits at partial opacity — and previously the solid-white base text
// stayed at full opacity directly underneath it for that whole band.
// Alpha-blending a translucent colored glyph over a fully-opaque white
// glyph doesn't read as "gradient fading in", it reads as pale, washed-out
// white edges bleeding around every letter — worse on fine strokes, since
// the mask's feather and the glyph's own antialiasing are two independent
// soft edges compounding on each other. That's the "white leaking edgy
// text" this fixes.
// Feeding the same --akyos-sweep value into a complementary mask on the
// base layer means at any instant the two opacities sum to ~1 across the
// whole feather band (base goes white -> transparent exactly where the
// overlay goes transparent -> white), so there's never a moment where a
// translucent white glyph and a translucent gradient glyph occupy the same
// pixels at once — it reads as one continuous crossfade along the sweep
// line. And because both masks share the one custom property plus the
// identical animation string, they can never drift out of sync with each
// other, however long the hover lasts.
